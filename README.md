# Cycle-cGAN_APSR-MMI-coupler
This repository provides an open-source implementation of a cycle-consistent conditional generative adversarial network (cycle cGAN) for the inverse design of 1Ã—2 multimode interference (MMI) couplers, which  is an application that combines deep learning and photonics device design.
